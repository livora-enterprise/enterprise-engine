# Livora Client Integration Scenarios — Full Infra vs Intelligence-as-a-Service

**Purpose:**
This document maps two complete delivery patterns for clients: (A) **Livora manages full frontend + infra** and (B) **Livora provides Intelligence-as-a-Service (IaaS)** to integrate with client systems. Use this to guide delivery, contracts, and engineering onboarding.

---

## Executive Summary
- **Pattern A (Full Delivery):** Livora builds, deploys, and operates the complete system for the client — website, mobile apps, CRM desktop, and the Intelligence Engine — typically deployed in the client cloud or Livora-managed account.
- **Pattern B (IaaS):** Client retains their UI & some infra; Livora provides the Intelligence Engine (APIs, analytics, automation) and connects via SDKs, connectors, or ingest APIs.

Both patterns produce identical intelligence outputs; only ownership, hosting, and integration work differ.

---

## Pattern A — Livora Full Delivery (Turnkey)

### Who chooses this
- Clients who want minimal engineering involvement.
- Businesses preferring a turnkey solution with fast time-to-value.

### What Livora delivers
1. Frontend (web + mobile + desktop CRM) — branded for client
2. Full backend infra (ingest, ops store, data lake, warehouse)
3. Campaign engine and automation workflows
4. AI/ML models & feature store
5. Monitoring, security, backups, and managed support

### Hosting options
- **Client Cloud (recommended):** Livora uses client AWS/GCP/Azure account; cross-account roles for deployment.
- **Livora Managed:** Runs in Livora AWS account with tenant isolation and contractual data access terms.

### Integration steps (high-level)
1. Discovery & design
2. Design approvals (Figma) for frontends
3. IaC provisioning (CDK/Terraform) in target account
4. Frontend integration of SDKs & auth
5. Pilot & QA
6. Production cutover

### Pros & Cons
- **Pros:** Best data quality; rapid feature rollout; single vendor responsibility.
- **Cons:** Higher initial implementation work; client relies on Livora for everything (unless transfer is arranged).

---

## Pattern B — Livora Intelligence-as-a-Service (IaaS)

### Who chooses this
- Clients with existing websites/apps, or who want to retain UI teams.
- Clients with strict compliance or who host in their own environment.

### What Livora delivers
1. Ingestion endpoints & SDKs for web/mobile
2. Read APIs and embedded dashboards
3. Campaign engine that can operate via webhooks or authorized delivery workers
4. Connectors for common platforms (Shopify, ERP, payment gateways)

### Integration options
- **Push Integration:** Client posts events to `POST /v1/events` from their backend or frontend.
- **Pull Integration:** Livora connectors poll client services or third-party APIs.
- **CDC Integration:** Use Debezium or similar to stream DB changes.

### Hosting & Data ownership
- Preferred: Livora deployed in client cloud account (client retains keys & KMS).
- Alternate: Livora-managed environment with strict data separation.

### Pros & Cons
- **Pros:** Client retains UI control; easier for clients with mature dev teams; lighter billing model.
- **Cons:** Requires client engineering effort; potential data quality issues if event coverage is incomplete.

## Mapping: Feature Availability by Pattern
| Feature | Pattern A (Full) | Pattern B (IaaS) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Full branded UI | ✅ | ❌ (client provided) |
| SDK integration | ✅ | ✅ |
| Campaign execution (Livora-run) | ✅ | ✅ (with client approval) |
| Embedded dashboards | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom ML models deployed in client infra | ✅ | Optional |
| Data ownership in client account | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## SLA & Operational Roles
- **Livora (Platform Team):** infra provisioning, engine updates, automation templates, model development.
- **Client (Product / Dev Team):** frontends, providing product catalog, domain verification, and any custom UI needs (Pattern B).
- **Managed Option:** Livora offers optional 24x7 support + monthly optimization sprints.

SLA samples (define in contract): uptime, event delivery guarantees, incident response time, and data retention terms.

---

## Security & Compliance (applies to both)
- Tenant isolation, KMS encryption, RBAC, and audit logs.
- Client may require SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA — provide compliance artifacts and deployment architecture tailored to those requirements.

---

## Onboarding Flow: Quick Comparison
1. **Pattern A (Full):** Onboard → Design → Provision → Build → Pilot → Launch → Handover/Managed Support
2. **Pattern B (IaaS):** Onboard → Map Events → Integrate SDKs/Connectors → Validate Events → Pilot → Launch → Handover/Support

---

## Developer Handoff Artifacts (deliver to client)
- OpenAPI spec for ingestion & read APIs
- SDK packages (JS, RN, Android, iOS)
- Dashboard embed tokens & instructions
- IaC templates (CDK) and deployment docs
- Runbooks & incident contacts

---

## Pricing / Commercial Notes (high level)
- Implementation fee for provisioning & integration (custom per client).
- Recurring: Managed service retainer or SaaS subscription (if Livora hosts).
- Add‑ons: custom ML models, additional connectors, enterprise compliance.

---

## Example: Quick-start for a Non-Technical Client (Pattern A)
1. Client signs MSA and data processing agreement.
2. Livora runs a 2‑day kickoff workshop (KPIs, funnels, sample data).
3. Livora spins up a sandbox environment with sample dashboards and pre-built campaign templates.
4. Client provides brand assets and product catalog CSV.
5. Livora uploads catalog, configures campaigns, and trains basic models on uploaded data.
6. Client logs into CRM and starts using dashboards & campaigns. Livora runs the first campaign with client approval.

---

## Closing — decision checklist for Sales/CS
- Does client want ownership of frontend? → choose Pattern B.
- Does client have strict infra/compliance needs? → prefer client cloud with cross‑account deploy.
- Does client want a turnkey experience? → Pattern A with managed option.
