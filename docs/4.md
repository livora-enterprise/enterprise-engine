# Livora Frontend Structure — UI / UX Handbook (A → Z)

**Purpose:**
This handbook explains, end‑to‑end, the frontend architecture, screen taxonomy, UX patterns, component system, and implementation guidance for the Livora platform (CRM desktop, Analytics dashboards, Campaign builder, and optional customer-facing storefront/mobile apps). Use this as the canonical frontend reference for designers, frontend engineers, and product owners.

---

## 1. Principles & Goals
- **Consistency:** single design system across web, mobile, and desktop.
- **Clarity:** data‑dense screens must be readable (typography, spacing).
- **Responsiveness:** layouts adapt across desktop/tablet/mobile.
- **Performance:** lazy load heavy visualizations; paginate large tables.
- **Extensibility:** component props & theming for client branding.

---

## 2. Tech Stack & Tooling
- **Frameworks:** React + Next.js (web), React Native (mobile), Electron + React (desktop CRM)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS + design tokens (theme variables)
- **Charts:** Recharts / Chart.js / D3 for custom visualizations
- **State:** Redux Toolkit or React Query for server state; context for UI state
- **Auth:** Cognito / Auth0 with JWT flows
- **i18n:** react-intl for multi-language support
- **Build & CI:** Vercel / Netlify for web preview, GitHub Actions for CI

---

## 3. Design System (Core)
- **Tokens:** color, spacing, typography, icons, elevation.
- **Core components:** Button, Input, Select, Modal, Table, DataCard, KPIChip, Avatar, Tag, Badge.
- **Layout components:** PageShell (header + nav), CardGrid, SideNav, TopNav, ResponsiveGrid.
- **Complex UI components:** DataTable (with column chooser + server pagination), FunnelVisualizer, CohortHeatmap, TimeSeriesChart, CampaignFlowEditor (drag & drop), FeatureToggle UI.

---

## 4. Screen Taxonomy (by module)

### A. Global
- Login / SSO
- Global Search (universal scope)
- Notifications center
- User & Team Settings

### B. Dashboard (Executive)
- Top KPIs (DAU, Revenue, Conversion %)
- Live event feed (recent actions)
- Campaign health (open rates / deliveries)
- Quick action widgets (Run campaign, Create segment)

### C. Analytics Studio
- Funnel Builder (step selector, cohort filter)
- Cohort Explorer (retention matrix)
- Product Performance (table + sparkline)
- Segment Builder (audience SQL/visual builder)
- Query Console (SQL + saved queries)

### D. CRM & Sales
- Contact List (search, bulk actions)
- Contact 360 Profile (timeline, orders, LTV, scores)
- Deals Board (kanban by stage) + Deal timeline
- Activity Inbox (tasks, calls, notes)

### E. Campaign Builder
- Campaign List & Stats
- Visual Journey Editor (drag nodes, timers, actions)
- Template Library (WhatsApp / Email templates)
- Audience Picker (segments or custom SQL)
- Delivery Preview & Throttling Settings

### F. Admin & Integrations
- Connectors list (Shopify, Razorpay, ERP)
- API Keys & Webhooks
- Feature Flags & Tenant config
- Audit logs & Compliance

## 5. UI Patterns & UX Guidelines
- **Data tables:** server-side pagination, column grouping, column-level filters, export CSV.
- **Charts:** interactive tooltips, zoom & brush for time series, small‑multiple grid for product comparisons.
- **Drill-down:** every KPI card links to detailed view with filters persisted.
- **Guided Onboarding:** first time users see a tour + example data toggles.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast.

---

## 6. Component Contracts (examples)
**DataCard** props:
- `title`, `value`, `trend`, `delta`, `sparklineData`, `onClick`

**FunnelVisualizer** props:
- `steps: [{name, count, conversions}]`, `onStepClick`, `groupBy`

**CampaignFlowEditor** features:
- Node types: trigger, delay, send_message, condition, branch
- Export/Import JSON representing workflow

---

## 7. Offline & Local Sync (CRM Desktop)
- Use local sqlite or IndexedDB for caching recent records.
- Sync strategy: write-through for actions that require server confirmation; queue offline interactions and drain when online.
- Conflict resolution: last-writer-wins for non-critical fields; require manual merge for payment/deal-critical conflicts.

---

## 8. Theming & Branding for Clients
- Theme file (JSON) containing colors, logo, primary/secondary fonts, button styles.
- Components read tokens at runtime; brand config loaded per-tenant at login.
- CSS variables + Tailwind config generated per-tenant during deploy time.

---

## 9. Performance & Observability
- Measure web vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and instrument dashboards.
- Lazy-load heavy charts; paginate server-side tables.
- Track client SDK errors and capture logs (Sentry).

---

## 10. Developer Experience & Repo Structure
